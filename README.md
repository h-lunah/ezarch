# ezArch
An easy way to get Arch installed on your machine!

## Contents
This script consists of two parts:
- ezarch.sh: installs the base system to your hard disk
- ezarch-chroot.sh: does post-setup of your newly installed arch system

## Get Started
To get started, `git clone https://github.com/piotr25691/ezarch` and run `ezarch.sh`.

Be aware that this will wipe your drive clean, so check if you got backups, or that you don't need stuff currently on your hard disk.

## Requirements
This script requires an IDE, SCSI or SATA disk, MMC storage is not supported.<br><br>

### Enjoy using Arch btw!

# ezArch
An easy way to get Arch installed on your machine!

## Contents
This script consists of two parts:
- ezarch.sh: installs the base system to your hard disk
- ezarch-chroot.sh: does post-setup of your newly installed arch system

## Get Started
To get started, run `git clone https://github.com/piotr25691/ezarch`, and then run `./ezarch.sh`.<br>All of this must be done in an Arch Linux Live CD!

Be aware that this will wipe your drive clean, so check if you got backups, or that you don't need stuff currently on your hard disk.

## Requirements
This script requires an IDE, SCSI or SATA disk, MMC storage is not supported.<br><br>

### Enjoy using Arch btw!
